We are checking over almost 400,000 halos, which are selected by mass and separation.
We then cycle through these, establishing another mass cutoff
I then found the probabilities that the separation, mass, and velocity matched the musketball
I divided this probability by the number of points we checked in that angle



I think it might be better to use Jayke's way of not varying the number of points on a halo pair. We would just add up all of the probabilities of each angle and divide by the number of points. It would check the probability of each one specifically.

I want help on figuring out if I wrote my gaussian graphs correctly


I need to send my cosmosim stuff to Nate
